    <h1>Most Powerful Countries in the the World</h1>
    <div class="country">
        <h3>1. USA</h3>
        <p>The US retains its position as the world's most-powerful country.

            US News calls it "the world's most dominant economic and military power" and notes now its "cultural imprint
            spans the world" thanks to its production of movies, TV, and music.

            It also noted that President Donald Trump's positions on immigration and trade "have raised questions around
            the world, including from the country's closest allies, about the nation's future course on the global
            stage."</p>

        <h3>2. Russia</h3>
        <p>Russia was also ranked 2nd last year.

            The scale of Russia is difficult to imagine," US News said.

            "It is the world's largest country by land mass – nearly twice as big as Canada, the world's second-largest
            nation – and covers all of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe. It shares land borders with more than a
            dozen countries, and shares sea borders with Japan and the United States."</p>

        <h3>3. China</h3>
        <p>China's position has not changed since last year.

            US News says it is "home to one of the world's oldest civilizations" and says it is "the world's most
            populous"
            and is one of the world's largest countries.</p>
